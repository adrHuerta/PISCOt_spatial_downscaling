# PISCOt_spatial_donwscaling

The downscaled version of [PISCOt v1.1, gridded maximum/minimun temperature](https://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.SENAMHI/.HSR/.PISCO/.Temp/?Set-Language=es) has been created using GWR (plus bilinear interpolation) using land surface temperature and elevation at 0.01° (~1 km) in a climatologically aided process (similar to the climatologically aided interpolation).

## Code

PISCOt_spatial_donwscaling is provided as a collection of R scripts. Step-by-step scripts for creating 1981-2016 downscaled version of [PISCOt v1.1](https://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.SENAMHI/.HSR/.PISCO/.Temp/?Set-Language=es) are provided in the process directory.
